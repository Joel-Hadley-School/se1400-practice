                <h2>Pong</h2>
                <p>Pong is a 1972 sports video game developed and published by Atari for arcades. 
                    It is one of the earliest arcade video games; it was created by Allan Alcorn as a training exercise assigned to him by Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell,
                    but Bushnell and Atari co-founder Ted Dabney were surprised by the quality of Alcorn's work and decided to manufacture the game. 
                    Bushnell based the game's concept on an electronic ping-pong game included in the Magnavox Odyssey, the first home video game console. 
                    In response, Magnavox later sued Atari for patent infringement.</p>

                <h2>Magnavox Odyssey</h2>
                <p>The Magnavox Odyssey is the first commercial home video game console. 
                    The hardware was designed by a small team led by Ralph H. Baer at Sanders Associates, 
                    while Magnavox completed development and released it in the United States in September 1972 and overseas the following year. 
                    The Odyssey consists of a white, black, and brown box that connects to a television set, and two rectangular controllers attached by wires. 
                    It is capable of displaying three square dots and one line of varying height on the screen in monochrome black and white, with differing behavior for the dots depending on the game played. 
                    Players place plastic overlays on the screen to display additional visual elements for each game, and one or two players for each game control their dots with the knobs and buttons on the controller by the rules given for the game. 
                    The console cannot generate audio or track scores. 
                    The Odyssey console came packaged with dice, paper money, and other board game paraphernalia to accompany the games, 
                    while a peripheral controller—the first video game light gun—was sold separately.</p>

                <h2>Space Invaders</h2>
                <p>Space Invaders is a 1978 shoot 'em up video game developed and published by Taito for arcades. 
                    It was released in Japan in April 1978, with the game being released by Midway Manufacturing overseas. 
                    Space Invaders was the first fixed shooter and the first video game with endless gameplay (meaning there was no final level or endscreen) and set the template for the genre. 
                    The goal is to defeat wave after wave of descending aliens with a horizontally moving laser cannon to earn as many points as possible.</p>
